This is my ongoing attempt to work on a platformer. My goal is to make the first level of Castlevania 4.

This program is currently using the most recent pygame ce.

- Current Bugs:
-   Game freaks out at low frame-rates.

- Plans for the future:
-   Put in whipping and item pickups, put player and gameobjects in objects script for reference.
-   Clean up sprite and tile data-base.
-   Fix low fps bugs.
-   Create game-states for bosses, title screens, etc.
